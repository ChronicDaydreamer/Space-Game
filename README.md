# Space-Game
/*
This is a long-term passion project that I have been working on. Eventually it will be a kind of rpg trading game where the player can travel between different star systems in a group of stars, buy and sell goods, and explore randomly generated systems. It is kind-of bare bones at the moment, but all of the info of each star system is realistically generated based on the parent stars initial mass. You can click on a star that you want to explore to see the planets that orbit it and see some info about it on the command line. 
To start it up you will want to compile both Main.java and Menu.java, but then you can play by just typing java Main. 
Yes this code is messy and not very good, but I think it is a good example that shows I can use all of the basic stuff, am able to teach myself hard concepts, and that I really do enjoy coding and developing.
