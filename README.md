# Space-Game
/*
This is a long-term passion project that I have been working on. Eventually it will be a kind of rpg trading game where the player can travel between different star systems in a group of stars, buy and sell goods, and explore randomly generated systems. It is kind-of bare bones at the moment, but all of the info of each star system is realistically generated based on the parent stars initial mass. You can click on a star that you want to explore to see the planets that orbit it and see some info about it on the command line. 
To start it up you will want to compile both Main.java and Menu.java, but then you can play by just typing java Main.
